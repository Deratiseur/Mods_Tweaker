@200 = ~Hey, hello adventurer. I see you're over-equipped, but no matter: what I have to offer will probably surpass anything you've ever dreamed of possessing. Take a look at my items and let yourself be amazed by these wonders from a faraway land.~
@201 = ~All right, let me see these "wonders".~
@202 = ~I doubt you have anything better to offer than what I already have. No, I'm fine.~
@203 = ~You're back... Would you like to see my trinkets? My armors? Make your choice...~
@204 = ~Um, I think I've already seen these items. It was another person who sold them~
@205 = ~Yes, it was my war sister, Jamella. She was in a bit of a hurry. Me, I've got all the time in the world. So, do you want to see?~
@206 = ~Yes, let me see what you have.~
@207 = ~No, thanks.~
